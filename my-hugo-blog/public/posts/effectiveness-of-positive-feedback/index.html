  <section><h1 id="positive-feedback-helps-because">Positive feedback helps because:</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>it reinforces existing good behavior,</strong></li>
<li><strong>it communicate that someone inspects the work, and</strong></li>
<li><strong>it opens the apperture to receive corrective feedback.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reinforcing good behavior helps maintain it. Managers can reasonably expect staff to complete 60% of assigned tasks; we want to preserve as much of that good behavior as possible. If we focus on correcting the missing 40%, most people will perform worse not better. Build foundations; reinforce the <em>existing</em> good stuff.</p>
<p>Staff sometimes perform poorly because they think no one performs inspections. <em>Why bother; nobody checks.</em> Positive feedback communicates that we do inspect. <em>Oh, you do check up on me.</em> Call it friendly Machiavellian.</p>
<p>Staff do need <em>some</em> corrective feedback. It only works, though, if they absorb it. Most people act like a camera; positive feedback opens the apperature a bit; corrective feedback closes it a lot. Make the camera receptive, remember to open the apperature. While people clearly differ in sensitivity, a ratio of 3:1 positive to corrective seems about right for most.</p>
<h1 id="a-few-tips-that-work-for-me">A few tips that work for me:</h1>
<p><strong>Use shaping</strong>.  Make the positive feedback relevant and incremental.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevant</strong>: While teaching someone to swim, praise the swimming technique. <em>Good coordination of legs and arms.</em></li>
<li><strong>Incremental</strong>: First praise getting in the water, then we praise floating, then blowing bubbles, et cetera.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make feedback <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>immediate</strong>. Point to observable behavior; do it within hours not days.</p>
<p>Remember, you don&rsquo;t have to do it perfectly (face it: you never will).</p>
