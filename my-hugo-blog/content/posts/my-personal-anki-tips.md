After 1,176 cards and 91 days of studying with Anki I now use these guidenlines.

Revision of cards is key: create cards, review cards, suspend cards, revise cards.

# Guidelines

1. Make cards very, very easy.
2. Prefer cloze deletions.
3. Minimize words.
4. When reviewing, suspend cards I dislike. Set a very low bar for suspension.
5. Revise suspended cards, then unsuspend 'em for a second chance.
   - Change Note Type `Ctrl + Shift + M`
   - Toggle Suspend `Ctrl + J`
   - Preview Clozes `Ctrl + L`
6. If a card seems unsalvagable, delete or archive it.
7. Archive cards by moving them to a new deck named Obsolete.
   - Change Deck: `Ctrl + D`
8. Review cards most days per week.
9. Review in blocks of 10 to 20 minutes.
