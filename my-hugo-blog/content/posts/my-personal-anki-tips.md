# Guidelines

1. Make cards very, very easy.
2. Prefer cloze deletions.
3. Minimize words.
4. Suspend cards I dislike. Set a very low bar for suspension.
5. Revise suspended cards then unsuspend, delete, or archive.
   - Change Note Type `Ctrl + Shift + M`
   - Toggle Suspend `Ctrl + J`
   - Preview Clozes `Ctrl + L`
6. Archive cards by moving them to a new deck named Obsolete.
   - Change Deck: `Ctrl + D`
7. Review cards most days per week.
8. Review in blocks of 10 to 20 minutes.
9. If reviewing becomes a _real_ drag, suspend more cards for revision.

Curation of cards is key.
