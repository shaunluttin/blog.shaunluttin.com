This is a very high level overview of how to create a new blog with GitHub using Hugo.

> Since we're using Windows, we use PowerShell and Chocolatey.

1. Create a new GitHub account.

2. Create a GitHub public repository for GitHub Pages.

3. Clone that repository to your local machine.

4. Publish your first plain text file as a GitHub Page. Done. Milestone achieved!

5. Get distracted by learning PowerShell, Git, and NeoVim. Yah!

6. Install Hugo! (`choco install hugo`).
