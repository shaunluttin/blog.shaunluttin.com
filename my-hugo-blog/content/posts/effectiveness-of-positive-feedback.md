Positive feedback helps because:

- **it reinforces existing good behavior,**
- **it communicate that someone inspects the work, and**
- **it opens the apperture to receive corrective feedback.**

A manager can reasonably expect a member of staff to do 60% of the tasks assigned. We do well to reinforce every little bit of that _existing_ 60%. Sure, we want them to improve, but first we need to solidify the existing 60% as a foundation for more.

Sometimes people perform poorly simply because they think no one cares. _Nobody notices what I do..._ We want people to know that we pay attention, but saying, "I'm watching you" tends to land as creepy. If we give positive feedback, we implicity communicate it.

We want people to add additional good behavior to their repetoire. Often that requires corrective feedback. People act like a camera; positive feedback opens the apperature a tiny bit; corrective feedback closes it. If you the camera to receive, you need to open the apperature.
