Positive feedback helps because:

- **it reinforces existing good behavior,**
- **it communicate that someone inspects the work, and**
- **it opens the apperture to receive corrective feedback.**

A manager can reasonably expect a member of staff to do 60% of assigned tasks. To help staff improve, we can reinforce every little bit of _existing_ good behavior. 

Staff sometimes perform poorly because they think no one notices. _Why bother trying; nobody notices what I do._ We want staff to know that we pay attention. _I'm watching you_ tends to land as creepy; instead, give positive feedback to communicate that implicity.

Often staff require corrective feedback; it only works if they absorb it it. People act like a camera; positive feedback opens the apperature a tiny bit; corrective feedback closes it a lot. To make the camera receptive, remember to open the apperature.
