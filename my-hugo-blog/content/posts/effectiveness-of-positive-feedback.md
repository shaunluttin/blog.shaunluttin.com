Positive feedback helps because:

- **it reinforces existing good behavior,**
- **it communicate that someone inspects the work, and**
- **it opens the apperture to receive corrective feedback.**

Reinforcing good behavior helps maintain it. Managers can reasonably expect staff to complete 60% of assigned tasks; we want to preserve as much of that good behavior as possible. If we focus on correcting the missing 40%, most people will perform worse not better. Build foundations; reinforce the _existing_ good stuff.

Staff sometimes perform poorly because they think no one performs inspections. _Why bother; nobody checks._ Positive feedback communicates that we do inspect. _Oh, you do check up on me._ Call it friendly Machiavellian.

Staff do need _some_ corrective feedback. It only works, though, if they absorb it. Most people act like a camera; positive feedback opens the apperature a bit; corrective feedback closes it a lot. Make the camera receptive, remember to open the apperature. While people clearly differ in sensitivity, a ratio of 3:1 positive to corrective seems about right for most.

**Use shaping**.  Make the positive feedback relevant and incremental.

* **Relevant**: While teaching someone to swim, praise the swimming technique. _Good coordination of legs and arms._
* **Incremental**: First praise getting in the water, then we praise floating, then blowing bubbles, et cetera.

Finally, make feedback specific and immediate. Point to an observable behavior and do it with within hours not days.
