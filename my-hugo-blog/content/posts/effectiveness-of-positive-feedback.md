Positive feedback helps because:

- **it reinforces existing good behavior,**
- **it communicate that someone inspects the work, and**
- **it opens the apperture to receive corrective feedback.**

Reinforcing good behavior helps maintain it. Managers can reasonably expect staff to complete 60% of assigned tasks; we want to preserve as much of that good behavior as possible. If we focus on correcting the missing 40%, most people will perform worse not better. So, mostly reinforce the _existing_ good stuff.

Staff sometimes perform poorly because they think no one performs inspections. _Why bother; nobody checks._ Positive feedback communicates that we do inspect work.

Staff do require _some_ corrective feedback. It only works, though, if they absorb it it. People act like a camera; positive feedback opens the apperature a bit; corrective feedback closes it a lot. Make the camera receptive, remember to open the apperature.
