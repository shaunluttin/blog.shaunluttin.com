Positive feedback helps because:

- **it reinforces existing good behavior,**
- **it communicate that someone inspects the work, and**
- **it opens the apperture to receive corrective feedback.**

Reinforcing good behavior helps maintain it. Managers can reasonably expect staff to complete 60% of assigned tasks; we want to preserve as much of that good behavior as possible. If we focus on correcting the missing 40%, most people will perform worse not better. Build foundations; reinforce the _existing_ good stuff.

Staff sometimes perform poorly because they think no one performs inspections. _Why bother; nobody checks._ Positive feedback communicates that we do inspect. _Oh, you do check up on me._ Call it friendly Machiavellian.

Staff do need _some_ corrective feedback. It only works, though, if they absorb it. Most people act like a camera; positive feedback opens the apperature a bit; corrective feedback closes it a lot. Make the camera receptive, remember to open the apperature. While people clearly differ in sensitivity, a ratio of 3:1 positive to corrective seems about right for most.

**Use shaping**. Make the positive feedback relevant to incremental improvements at the goal. 
* Relevant: While teaching someone to swim, complement their swimming technique not their meal planning. _Good coordination of your legs and arms on that lap_ works better than _nice lunch you brought today_.
* Incremental: With an ultimate goal of swimming laps, we first praise getting in the water, then we praise floating, then blowing bubbles, and we reinforce each along the way.
