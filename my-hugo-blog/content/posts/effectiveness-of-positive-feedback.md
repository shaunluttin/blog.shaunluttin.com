Positive feedback helps because:

- **it reinforces existing good behavior,**
- **it communicate that someone inspects the work, and**
- **it opens the apperture to receive corrective feedback.**

A manager can reasonably expect a member of staff to do 60% of the tasks assigned. Reinforce every little bit of the _existing_ 60%. Sure, we want staff to improve. First, though, solidify the existing performance.

Sometimes people perform poorly because they think no one cares. _Nobody notices what I do..._ We want staff to know that we pay attention. Since saying, "I'm watching you" tends to land as creepy instead give positive feedback to communicate it implicity.

We want people to add additional good behavior to their repetoire. Often that requires corrective feedback. People act like a camera; positive feedback opens the apperature a tiny bit; corrective feedback closes it. If you the camera to receive, remember to open the apperature.
