# Positive feedback helps because:

- **it reinforces existing good behavior,**
- **it communicate that someone inspects the work, and**
- **it opens the apperture to receive corrective feedback.**

Reinforcing good behavior helps maintain it. Managers can reasonably expect staff to complete 60% of assigned tasks; we want to preserve that good behavior. If we focus on correcting the missing 40%, most people will perform worse. Build foundations; reinforce the _existing_ good stuff.

Staff sometimes perform poorly because they think no one performs inspections. _Why bother; nobody checks._ Positive feedback communicates that we do inspect. _Oh, you do check up on me._ Call it friendly Machiavellian.

Staff do need _some_ corrective feedback. It only works, though, if they absorb it. Most people act like a camera; positive feedback opens the apperature a bit; corrective feedback closes it a lot. Remember to open the apperature. While people differ in sensitivity, most find a ratio of 3:1 positive to corrective about right.

#  A few tips that work for me:

**Use shaping**.  Make the positive feedback relevant and incremental.

* **Relevant**: While teaching someone to swim, praise the swimming technique. _Good coordination of legs and arms._
* **Incremental**: First praise getting in the water, then we praise floating, then blowing bubbles, et cetera.

Make feedback **specific** and **immediate**. Point to observable behavior; do it within hours not days.

Remember, you don't have to do it perfectly (face it: you never will).
