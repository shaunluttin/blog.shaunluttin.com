When PhD students do their thesis defense, experts fly in to grill the student.
Good thesis advisors train students to answer each question _and then shut-up_. 
Students almost always feel a temptation to elaborate.

Examiner: _Why did you use that particular statistical test?_

Student: _We used regression because our data met its requirements for establishing cause-and-effect._

Examiners: _Silence._

Student: _We designed our data collection to adhere to parametric test requirements. Within the parametric set of tests, we also looked at comparison tests and correlation tests. We found a few t-test approaches that we could have used with fewer predictors..._

The follow-up answer gives examiners opportunities to ask follow up questions.

So, answer the question _and shut-up._
